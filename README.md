# Aivo-Sim: AI-Driven Simulation of Protein Expression for Anti-Aging Research

**Author**: Xandor Lane  
**Repository**: [github.com/xandorlane/aivo-sim](https://github.com/xandorlane/aivo-sim)

---

## ðŸ§  Overview
**Aivo-Sim** is the simulation core of the Aivo system â€” an AI-powered platform designed to model changes in protein expression and their systemic impact on aging. This project focuses on simulating the upregulation and downregulation of key proteins, predicting biological consequences, and discovering promising anti-aging targets.

---

## ðŸš€ Goals
- Develop a generative AI system that simulates how protein expression shifts affect cellular and systemic aging processes
- Identify potential protein targets that may extend lifespan or improve regenerative capacity
- Provide a reproducible, data-driven simulation environment for future experimental and therapeutic research

---

## ðŸ§¬ Current Protein Targets
This version includes modeling of 10 key proteins linked to aging and longevity:
- SIRT1
- GDF11
- IGF1
- p16 (CDKN2A)
- FOXO3
- Klotho
- NRF2
- mTOR
- AMPK
- TNF-alpha
